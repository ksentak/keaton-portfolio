This is the source code for my personal portfolio site. The site includes 4
pages: Home, About, Portfolio, & Contact. The `Home` page displays my social
links. Visitors can download a copy of my resume from the `About` page. The
`Portfolio` page hosts some of the projects I have built in my free time.
You can get in touch with me by filling out the form on the `Contact` page.
